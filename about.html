        <p style="color: white; padding-left: 2rem;"> What distinguishes a great school from a good school? I believe
            that clarity of
            purpose, exceptional
            teachers, and demonstrated outcomes are hallmarks of great schools. A great school is a place with a deep
            commitment to student learning, where faculty nourish the intellectual, moral, emotional, and social growth
            of every student. It is a place where students, teachers, and parents embark together on an academic journey
            with clear and well-defined objectives. It is filled with the joy of discovery and the excitement of
            personal challenge and growth. It is a community dedicated to developing strength of character and
            excellence in all dimensions of its students' lives. And it is a place that has a distinctive and lasting
            impact.
            <br> IT 2020 BATCH International School strives to be a great school. Our mission, simply put, is to prepare
            students for lives of purpose, achievement, and generosity of spirit. Our talented faculty are experts in
            their disciplines with a deep commitment to student success; they truly get to know each child, providing
            the challenge, support, and encouragement that fosters learning and personal growth. Our rigorous program of
            inquiry and study empowers students to exercise their intellectual curiosity, expand their understanding,
            and develop critical skills for future success. And our emphasis on character and values challenges each
            student to be a person of integrity, a contributing member of our school community, and a thoughtful and
            involved citizen of the world. </b>
